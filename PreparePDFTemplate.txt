Preparation of Templates
========================
* If the PDF template works (can be read in), fine
* If not, try any of the following
  - try to preprocess it with pdftk
  - try to convert it to ps (pdf2ps) and then back to pdf (ps2pdf)
  - try to print it to a pdf printer 
  - try to print it to a ps printer (best using a driver for an old 
    Apple Laserwriter, will be just plain PS) and convert to pdf
  which, with some luck, gives you a readable PDF template. If all 
  that fails make a jpeg/bmp copy with a scanner. Pixel formats always 
  work (which is the reason why for archiving only TIFF and OCR is a 
  viable option as long as ADOBE is involved with PDF)
