# longer text, continuation with \ at the end
para1=This is a longer text, that is automatically inserted. \
We do support escapes at the end of the line.
para2=Avoid using text, that is longer than what fits onto \
a single line. Because the origin of the point is at the \
lower left corner and not, which would be more intuitive \
on the upper left corner

# a paragraph mixed with reportlab markup  
para3=The text may include <b>bold</b>, \
<i>italic</it> and mixtures such as <b><i>bold italic</i></b> \
as well as <u>underline</u> and <strike>strike</strike> from \
reportlab. Do <b><font color="red">not</font></b> \
<font color=blue size=17>over<super>do</super></font> it.

# with primitives we ignore the style (but may use the width?)

# it should be easy to define some additional pass through primitives
